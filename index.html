  🦆

  this is the part were wherein we demo provisioning and deploying an app
  globally available, theoretically infinitely scalable, dns, the whole enchilada 

  in like 15-20 mins which is … pretty ok 
  
  (literally better than anything else ever in th history of compute. just saying!)


  then we recap the key points in slide form to reenforce and catch anything I missed or fucked up

<section>
  <b>Functions</b> are the 🔑 to a pure cloud native serverless architecture
</section>

<section>
  Functions are the unit of deployment <h1>not the entire app</h1>
</section>

<section>
  🤦‍♀️  You do not want to put an entire app in a single function. Downsides of a monolithic app plus ever increasing coldstart penalty. 
</section>

<section>
  <b>Lambda</b> has v nice characteristics
</section>
<!-- understatement -->

<section>
  <h3>Only paying for what you use 💸</h3> (💯% utilization)
</section>

<section>
<h3>Better security model 🔐</h3>
No ports to scan!
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Focusing on business value 💰</h3> instead of managing infra
</section>

<section>
<h3>FaaS is best in class serverless</h3>
<ul style=text-align:left>
<li class=fragment>💰 Fixed costs
<li class=fragment>🔒 Better security
<li class=fragment>🎢 Faster iterations
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Major 🔑</h3> 
<h1>functions are faster to deploy!</h3>
</section>
<!-- with .arc anyhow! -->

<section>
So why is a bunch of little functions a BFD?
</section>

<section>
Deploying a single function usually completes within a couple of seconds.
</section>

<section>
Deploy one or deploy all <i>in parallel</i>.
</section>

<section>
This is an order of magnitude improvement in most development workflow lead times to staging and/or production environments.
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Speed.</h1>
  <li class=fragment>Authortime is faster
  <li class=fragment>Runtime smaller due to less deps
  <li class=fragment>Bug resolution easier
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Faster...reading, writing, running and fixing code! 🙇🏽‍♂️</h3>
  <small>Seems worth exploring.</small>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Let's be excellent to each other.</h3>
  <small>No more code shaming! There is no singular "right" way.</small>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Backend is Yours 😈 <h1>
